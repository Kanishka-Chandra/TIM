This is a project which I started as a side project. The initial objective of this project was to control the mouse functions with voice. Months later the program is more or less in the same form. While coding this I was struck with an ideal thet there are many who are not able to use computer like a normal human being because of some physical disability. Though this is far from complete or in state of any proper use I am still uploading this for anyone to download and use it as he please, though I would highly appreciated if this project is not distributed as a commercial product.
